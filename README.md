# Credit Risk Model Using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates **building a credit risk model using logistic regression from scratch**. It involves preprocessing the dataset, balancing classes, fitting a logistic regression model, and visualizing feature importances using model coefficients.

## üìå Project Description

Credit risk modeling is crucial in financial institutions for evaluating the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. This project builds a logistic regression-based binary classification model to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk borrowers.

## üß∞ Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `imblearn`
- `scikit-learn`

## üîç Key Steps

- Data preprocessing and one-hot encoding of categorical variables
- Feature scaling and balancing
- Logistic regression model training
- Model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC
- Visualization of feature importances using model coefficients
